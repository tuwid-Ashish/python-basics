### Nature of Python Data Types

- Mutable vs Immutable Data Types
    - **Mutable**: Data types that can be changed after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets)
    - **Immutable**: Data types that cannot be changed after creation (e.g., strings, tuples, integers, floats)

### Detailed Description of Python Data Types

Python has several built-in data types, including:
- **Numeric Types**: int, float, complex
- **Sequence Types**: list, tuple, range
- **Text Type**: str
- **Set Types**: set, frozenset
- **Mapping Type**: dict
- **Boolean Type**: bool
- **Binary Types**: bytes, bytearray, memoryview

## Practice Questions: If-Else Statements

1. Write a Python program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. Write a Python program to find the largest of three numbers.
3. Write a Python program to check if a year is a leap year or not.
4. Write a Python program to check if a character is a vowel or consonant.

## Next Class Topic

In the next class, we will dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. We will cover:
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
