### Nature of Python Data Types

- Mutable vs Immutable Data Types
    - **Mutable**: Data types that can be changed after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets)
    - **Immutable**: Data types that cannot be changed after creation (e.g., strings, tuples, integers, floats)

### Detailed Description of Python Data Types

Python has several built-in data types, including:
- **Numeric Types**: int, float, complex
- **Sequence Types**: list, tuple, range
- **Text Type**: str
- **Set Types**: set, frozenset
- **Mapping Type**: dict
- **Boolean Type**: bool
- **Binary Types**: bytes, bytearray, memoryview

## Practice Questions: If-Else Statements

1. Write a Python program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. Write a Python program to find the largest of three numbers.
3. Write a Python program to check if a year is a leap year or not.
4. Write a Python program to check if a character is a vowel or consonant.

## Next Class Topic

In the next class, we will dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. We will cover:
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation

# Python Basics Morning Class Notes

## Introduction to Python Basics
Welcome to the Python Basics class! Today, we will learn foundational programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and basic data structures like tuples and sets. This class is designed for beginners, so we will use simple data types like numbers and strings for problem-solving.

## Loops
Loops allow us to repeat a block of code multiple times. Let's explore some examples:

1. Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.
2. Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 20.
3. Print each character of the string "Python" on a new line.
4. Count the number of vowels in the string: `"programming is fun"`.
5. Find the factorial of a number using a loop.
6. Create a program that repeatedly asks for user input until the user types "stop".

---

## Conditionals
Conditionals allow us to make decisions in our code. Here are some practice questions:

1. Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. Determine if a number is even or odd.
3. Check if a string starts with the letter 'P'.
4. Verify if the string "hello world" contains the word "hello".
5. Compare two numbers and print the larger one.
6. Check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.

---

## Functions
Functions help us organize code into reusable blocks. Practice the following:

1. Create a function that takes a number and returns its square.
2. Write a function to greet a user by their name (e.g., `greet("Alice")` should print "Hello, Alice!").
3. Create a function to find the length of a string.
4. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.
5. Check if a string is a palindrome (e.g., "madam" is a palindrome).
6. Find the maximum of three numbers using a function.

---

## Tuples and Sets
Tuples and sets are simple but essential data structures in Python. Letâ€™s explore them:

### Tuples
1. Access the second and last elements of the tuple `(10, 20, 30, 40)`.

### Sets
2. Find the union and intersection of two sets: `{1, 2, 3}` and `{3, 4, 5}`.

---

## Additional Topics (Optional)
If time permits, we will briefly cover:

1. **Variables and Data Types**: Learn how to store and manipulate numbers and strings.
2. **Input and Output**: Write programs that take user input and display results.
3. **String Manipulation**: Explore string slicing and methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, and `.replace()`.
4. **Basic Math Operations**: Solve problems using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
